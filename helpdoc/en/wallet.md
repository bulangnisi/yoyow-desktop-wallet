# About YOYOW Wallet

YOYOW is a media public chain based on blockchain technology. The wallet is a web-based application, which is operated in a browser and connected through a trusted node. You can conveniently manage your YOYO assets here.

## Wallet Security

Please make sure to [back up] (backups.md) your private key (only appears once upon successful registration). The browser will not store your private Owner Key. Other private keys from lower authority levels will be encrypted using your wallet password and stored in the browser’s local database.

## Account Recovery

Your account can be rebuilt using the private Owner Key while certain circumstances (such as switching computer, computer failure or browser crash) lead to the loss of local data on your browser.


## Balance
- The balance can be seen as your account’s primary wallet. To transfer balances and pay fees, you will need to have active authority over the funds.
- The YOYO in the balance can accumulate Bonus Points.
- We recommend storing most of your YOYO in the balance.


## Liquid Assets
- Liquid assets can be seen as your account’s auxiliary wallet for small amounts of savings and transfers, requiring the secondary authority level.
- YOYO in liquid assets cannot accumulate Bonus Points.
- As third-party platform may acquire secondary authority, we recommend only keeping a small amount of YOYO in liquid assets.
